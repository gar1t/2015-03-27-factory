# Patterns

- "This is what people tend to thing of"
- Show book cover
- Example of a few patterns
- My story: motivation, practice, outcome
- Current "reflex/reflux"

---

# Timeless Way of Building

- Incidentally reading - people said so
- Realized this was the alleged source of patterns
- Read what Alexander is saying - liked it
- Realized that people in software are getting this wrong!

---

# Alexander's Patterns vs Software Patterns

- this vs that (use source material) - quotes

---

# Alexander Patterns

- Observed that there was a change as industrialized society emerged
  -> architects took over, people accepted what they were give,
  abdicating their role in developing pattern languages

---

# Can it be applied to software?

- Quotes from Alexander

---

# Of course it can - very easily!

- I was struggling with this - how does this work? what's the method?
  does it make any sense?

---

# Why are pattern languages important? - So what?

- Accelerator - time to market?
- Maximize code reuse?

---

# Applying Alexander's method to Erlang

- Why just Erlang? Why not functional? Or programming in general?

---

# The Methodology

- Has to exist
- Should appear repeatedly
- Grounded in human experience

---

# What will the result be? What's the "grand vision?"

---

# Erlang Patterns - Organization

- Function type
- Application level facility
- Process/behavior types
- Erlang/OTP Constructs
    - Module
    - Behaviors
    - Supervised process
    - Supervisor
    - Application
    - Release
    - Function
    - Case/If Expression
    - Data types, etc.
- Distribution facilities
- Cluster level facilities
- Principles

---

## Pattern: Task

- Scope: Process type

---

## Pattern: Stats Sink

- Scope: Application level facility
- Where used: Need process specific stats without impacting process performance

---

## Pattern: Process Registry

- Scope: Application level facility
- Where used: Need to lookup processes by more than just a name (e.g. type)

---

## Pattern: Cleanup Crew

- Scope: Application level facility
- Where used: Cleanup after other tasks

---

## Pattern: Connection Pool

- Scope: Application level facility
- Where used: Manage connection resources

---

## Pattern: Crash by Default

- Scope: Principle
- Where used: Everywhere

---

## The Website - erlangpatterns.org

- All static content
- Uses LambdaPad - yay!
- Managed on github using revised C4.1 (check this name)

---

## General Methodology (move this up before examples?)

- Pattern must be concrete and something you can point to somewhere in code
- Pattern should occur repeatedly over a sufficiently long period of time to gain real world experience
- Pattern should be "feel good" when experienced (coding, running, maintaining)


---

## Closing Thoughts


---




- A problem

    - Stats on how patterns have taken hold

- The alleged inspiration (TTWOB)

- Alexander's response - confused - disconnect - etc

- Who cares anyway? What if these patterns have taken hold, but are
  wrong (per Alexander)? Does it matter?

- On the import of a pattern language

... stuff on pattern languages, the vision, etc...

- A Pattern Language for Erlang

- The methodology (rules)

- Some examples

- Categories (show that the examples have to fit somewhere)

- Surprise! There is no "Erlang pattern language" - the languages are
  per person

- *My* pattern language

- The project - let's work on this!
